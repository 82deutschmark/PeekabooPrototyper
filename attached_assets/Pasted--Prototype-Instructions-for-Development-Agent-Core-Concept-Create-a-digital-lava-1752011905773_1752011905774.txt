## **Prototype Instructions for Development Agent**

### **Core Concept**
Create a **digital lava lamp experience** - a mesmerizing, continuous physics diorama where circular sprites gently roll down inclined platforms. This is **NOT a game** (no scoring, winning, losing) and **NOT a book** (no story progression). It's a calming, semi-passive experience that toddlers can gently influence through optional touch interaction.

### **Visual Layout & Orientation**
- **Landscape orientation** (iPhone-style dimensions: ~16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Donkey Kong-inspired platform layout**: zigzag descent with wooden ramps
- **Circular billboard sprites** (like coins) that roll down the platforms
- **Gentle, trackable motion** - slow enough for toddlers to visually follow

### **Physics Behavior**
- **Reduced gravity** (about 30% of normal) for slow, dreamy movement
- **Circular sprites bounce and roll** down inclined wooden platforms
- **Different sprite types** have slightly different physics (some bounce more, some roll differently)
- **Continuous spawning** - new sprites appear every 8-12 seconds at the top
- **Bottom collection** - sprites fade away peacefully after reaching the bottom

### **Interaction Model**
- **Single tap input only** - tap a rolling sprite to give it a gentle nudge
- **Optional interaction** - the experience continues whether user taps or not
- **Gentle feedback** - small sparkle effect and soft sound when tapped
- **No failure states** - impossible to "break" or "lose"
- **Predictable responses** - taps always produce the same gentle result

### **Atmosphere & Feel**
- **Soothing color palette** - warm, soft colors that won't overstimulate
- **Predictable rhythms** - regular spawning creates anticipation and comfort
- **Gentle audio** - soft background ambience, pleasant sounds on interaction
- **Visual calm** - smooth movements, no sudden changes or jarring effects

### **Target Experience**
Think **digital aquarium** or **screensaver with touch** - something a parent would use to occupy a toddler during a restaurant meal or as a pre-naptime wind-down. The child can watch peacefully or gently participate, but never gets frustrated or overwhelmed.

**Key Philosophy**: If a toddler puts the device down and walks away, the experience continues beautifully on its own. If they engage, they feel a gentle sense of influence without any pressure to "perform" or achieve objectives.
